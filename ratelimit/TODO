# ratelimit

* improve tests
* cli write the reset time into the log?
* think of how to implement the rate limiter accross handlers
* update readme. mention article of figma and that 429 response might not be
the best approach for a public API
* think of test that would hammer the rate limiter to gather stats.
this should then be useful to compare different implementations.
