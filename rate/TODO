# ratelimiter

* fix race condition in implementation
* update readme. mention article of figma and that 429 response might not be
the best approach for a public API and merge to main
* think of how to implement the rate limiter accross handlers
* think of test that would hammer the rate limiter to gather stats.
this should then be useful to compare different implementations.
* implement another rate limiter. introduce an interface Limiter with Limit()
move TokenBucket to its own bucket package renaming the struct to Limiter
